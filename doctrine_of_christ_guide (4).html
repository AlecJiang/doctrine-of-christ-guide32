    <h2>Faith in Jesus Christ</h2>
    <p>Faith is a principle of action and power. It means trusting Jesus Christ, believing in His power to save, and acting according to His word. Faith is the first step on the path of discipleship and opens the way for personal revelation and miracles in our lives. It leads us to obey God’s commandments and builds our confidence in His promises, especially when facing uncertainty and trials.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="repentance">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlecJiang/doctrine-of-christ-guide2/main/images/repentance.png" alt="Repentance illustration">
    <h2>Repentance</h2>
    <p>Repentance is a change of heart and behavior. It involves turning away from sin and seeking to follow Christ more fully. True repentance brings peace, spiritual strength, and a renewed relationship with God. It is more than saying sorry—it includes recognizing our mistakes, feeling godly sorrow, confessing when necessary, making restitution, and striving never to repeat the sin again. Repentance allows us to grow closer to the Savior and feel His grace in our lives.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="baptism">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlecJiang/doctrine-of-christ-guide2/main/images/baptism.png" alt="Baptism illustration">
    <h2>Baptism by Proper Authority</h2>
    <p>Baptism is a sacred ordinance and covenant. It symbolizes purification, rebirth, and the official entrance into Christ’s church. This ordinance must be performed by one with proper priesthood authority. Through baptism, we promise to take upon ourselves the name of Christ, keep His commandments, and serve Him to the end. It is a sign to God, angels, and others that we are willing to follow the Savior with full purpose of heart.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="holyghost">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlecJiang/doctrine-of-christ-guide2/main/images/holyghost.png" alt="Holy Ghost illustration">
    <h2>The Gift of the Holy Ghost</h2>
    <p>After baptism, we are confirmed and invited to receive the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost—a source of comfort, revelation, protection, and guidance throughout our lives. The Holy Ghost teaches us truth, warns us of danger, and helps us feel God's love. To keep this gift, we must remain spiritually clean and sensitive to His promptings. His influence can enlighten our minds, strengthen our hearts, and help us make righteous choices every day.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="endure">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlecJiang/doctrine-of-christ-guide2/main/images/endure.png" alt="Enduring illustration">
    <h2>Enduring to the End</h2>
    <p>Enduring to the end means to remain faithful throughout life. It involves daily repentance, keeping covenants, serving others, and trusting in Christ even in trials and hardship. This is how we prepare to return to our Heavenly Father. Enduring does not mean perfection but consistent effort to follow the Savior. With His help, we can overcome sin, endure suffering with hope, and grow spiritually as we progress toward eternal life.</p>
